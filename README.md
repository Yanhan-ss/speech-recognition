The rnn_lm.ipynb file shows how we can train a recurrent neural network language model.

[spchlab](https://github.com/compi1234/spchlab) is a Repository of Jupyter Notebooks for Speech Recognition Demos, Tutorials, and Exercises. Many of the exercises of my course speech recognition reside on spchlab.
